## Overview

This analysis is looking for microenvironmental differences or gradients within transects.

We're using this [GAM approach](http://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2014/05/09/modelling-seasonal-data-with-gam/).  In this approach, there are two smoothers (as Robi suggested).  One smoother is a cubic spline that accounts for intra-day variation.  Then a second spline is fitted to account for temporal variation that is not intra-day.  

Readings have temporal autocorrelation, therefore, we add an autoregressive moving average correlation structure (corAR1). We set the form here to account for autocorrelation separately for each transect position, treating positions as independent.  In every case, accounting for autocorrelation improves the models considerably, however, significant autocorrelation is still unaccounted for.  Zuur et. al. say that it's usually not worth finding the optimal autocorrelation structure.  

After all temporal effects are accounted for, we test for differences among transect positions separately for each transect (woods and meadow) and each variable (temperature, humidity, vwc, par).

We do this with two models: in one the transect positions are treated as individual factors, and there is no explicit spatial trend.  In the other, transect positions are treated as a continuous variable, testing for a gradient.

**Expectations:**

1. The woods VWC should increase (wetter) from 1 to 4, moving down the hill (no, but heterogeneity)
2. The meadow VWC should increase (wetter) from 1 to 4, moving into the swamp (yes)
3. The woods temperature should get cooler from 1 to 4, moving down the hill (no)
4. There should be no difference in PAR, or in temperature @ the meadow
    1. In fact, there are slight gradients in PAR in both sites, especially the meadow
    2. No differences in temp at the meadow
5. Humidity is unclear, but perhaps it would mirror soil moisture patterns
    1. No gradient, but some heterogeneity (in the meadow)


#### Transects

* Meadow: 1 (dry, sunny, grassy) to 4 (wet, some shade from ferns and shrubs)
* Woods: 1 (highest part of hill, but not top) to 4 (bottom of hill)

## Temperature


### Meadow Temperature

The model that includes transect order is worse than the base temporal model for meadow temperature.

There are no significant differences between position 2, 3, and 4 (1 is bad data and removed).  The maximum difference is 0.65 ยบC between positions.

**NOTE:** Position two is the reference level for this model: the intercept is the temperature for position 2.

## Volumetric Water Content

### Meadow VWC

The model that includes transect order as a continuous fixed factor is better than the base temporal model for meadow soil volumetric water content.  However, the base model is better than the model with transect order as a factor.  

The continuous model shows a positive trend towards increased soil moisture of about 0.039 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> per position. This matches the pattern expected as the transect goes into the swamp.  

The factor model shows minimal differences between positions 1 and 2 (not significant).  However, position 3 is wetter, and position 4 is a lot wetter.  This is also what the data show, and qualitatively what one might expect.  

Also, an ANOVA shows that the factor model is better than the base temporal model, though AIC doesn't agree.

### Woods VWC

The model that includes transect order is better than the base temporal model for woods soil volumetric water content.  

The actual pattern is a bit odd, though it matches qualitative results.  The highest point on the hill (position 1) is the driest, while the second position is the wettest.  Position 3 is not different from position 2, and position 4 is intermediate between 1 and 2 in soil moisture.  

So, while there are differences among transect positions, there isn't really a gradient.

### Meadow PAR

The model that includes transect order is better than the base temporal model for meadow PAR.  

There are no differences between positions 1 and 2, but 3 and 4 have increasingly lower PAR, with a maximum difference of 108 ยตmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s between position 2 and 4.  The difference between 1 and 3 is not significant (p = 0.08), but the difference between 1 and 4 is.  

This pattern can probably be explained by the increasing vegetation, especially in positions 3 and 4 that must be adding a small amount of shade.

### Woods PAR

The model that includes transect order is better than the base temporal model for woods PAR.  

PAR increases from the highest position on the hill (position 1) to the bottom (position 4).  There are no significant differences between positions 1-3, but position 4 has significantly higher par, with a maximum difference of 18.7 ยตmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s between position 1 and 4.  

It's unclear what explains this difference. Perhaps light is coming from the forest edge?
