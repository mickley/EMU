# EMU Analyses & Data

This folder contains all data and R analyses for the EMU project.  

Data files are stored as subfolders inside the [Data](../../tree/master/EMU-Analysis/Data) folder, along with any code to process them, and possibly small analyses.

More substantial analyses can occupy subfolders in the [Analyses](../../tree/master/EMU-Analysis/Analyses) folder, using the [template](/EMU-Analysis/Analyses/Template/Analysis-template.Rmd) as a starting poing for high quality ggplot figures
