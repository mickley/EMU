# Analyses

The following are analyses on EMU performance in the field associated with our paper.

## List of Analyses
* **[Calibration](EMU-Analysis/Analyses/Calibration/Calibration.md)** - Calibration of soil moisture and light sensors.
* **[Sensor Comparisons](EMU-Analysis/Analyses/Fenton%20Hypotheses/Sensor-Comparison.md)** - Comparisons of EMU temperature and humidity readings with those from iButtons and Hobos.
* **[Hypotheses](EMU-Analysis/Analyses/Fenton%20Hypotheses/Fenton_Hypotheses.md)** - A qualitative analysis of how our microenvironmental data matched *a priori* hypotheses for differences between and within transects.
* **[Transect Comparison Models](EMU-Analysis/Analyses/Fenton%20Hypotheses/Transect_Comparison_Models.md)** - A quantitative analysis of the microenvironmental differences between the woods and meadow transects.
* **[Within-Transect Models](EMU-Analysis/Analyses/Fenton%20Hypotheses/Within-Transect_Models.md)** - A quantitative analysis of the microenvironmental differences within transects.
* **[Paired T-Tests](EMU-Analysis/Analyses/Fenton%20Hypotheses/Paired-T-tests.md)** - An alternative analysis of between-transect differences
