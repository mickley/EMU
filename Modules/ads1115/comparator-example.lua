-- This is an example of using the comparator on the ADS1115 to 
-- trigger the ALERT pin when certain conditions are met
-- Connect the ALERT pin to D4 (built-in LED) to see how it works
-- The LED will turn on when ALERT goes low

-- Set the SDA and SCL pins to use for IÂ²C communication
sda = 2 -- GPIO4
scl = 1 -- GPIO5

-- Configure D4 as an input, so we can check whether it's on
gpio.mode(4, gpio.INPUT)

-- Load the module

-- Initialize the module with the sda and scl pins
ads1115.init(sda, scl)

-- Set the sensor to measure continuously
ads1115.setMode("continuous")

-- Setup the comparator
-- Trigger when voltage goes above 3V (3 / 6.144 * 32767 = 15999)
-- Turn off trigger when voltage goes below 2V (2 / 6.144 * 32767 = 10666)
-- Only require one measurement to cross threshold to trigger
-- Alert pin will go low when activated
-- No latching, hysteresis mode
