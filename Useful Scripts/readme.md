## Useful Scripts

The following scripts are are broadly useful and worth including on Nodes

* **[Setupwifi](setupwifi.lua)** - This script lets you setup wifi in Esplorer.  It asks for the network name and password and then tries to connect.  It's included as an option for init.lua.
* **[Info](info.lua)** - This prints out lots of useful information on the particular Node it's running on.  Includes NodeMCU version, chip, wifi, and filesystem information.  It's included as an option for init.lua.
* **[i2c Scanner](i2c_scanner.lua)** - This is a useful scanner that finds out which pins i2c devices are connected to, and what their addresses are.
* **[Graphics test](graphics test.lua)** - This is a test of the OLED display.  Useful to see if the display is set up right and working, and also as a reference on how to do things with u8g, which is poorly documented.
