# EMUs

This repository stores code, documentation, and analyses for environmental microcontroller units (EMUs). We detail their use in [our manuscript]() for measuring aspects of microenvironment: temperature, humidity, light, and soil moisture for less than $20 for the hardware costs. However, their flexible nature means that they can be used in a variety of research situations where inexpensive sensors are required 

If this work is useful in your research, please cite our paper: [citation].

We provide the following:
* [Detailed documentation](/Documentation) including [building EMUs](/Documentation/Building%20EMUs.md), [parts list](/Documentation/), [programming EMUs](/Documentation/EMU%20programming.md), [troubleshooting](/Documentation/Troubleshooting.md), and [circuit diagrams](/Documentation/Diagrams/).
* EMU [operating code](/EMU-Software).
* A [pre-built firmware](/Firmware)
* Our [analyses and data](EMU-Analysis) used in calibrating light and soil moisture sensors and in a field test of EMUs.
